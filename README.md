# [ICEE Locator](http://github.com/emilylakic/iceelocator/)

[The ICEE Locator](https://github.com/emilylakic/iceelocator) provides users the ability to find the nearest location carrying ICEE's based on their current location. The app built by [Emily Lakic] (https://www.github.com/emilylakic) and [Mark Caldropoli] (https://www.github.com/markcaldropoli) and won the award for the **Best Reverse Engineering App**.

### How We Built It

We built the ICEE Locator using the programming language **Swift** and the software **Xcode**. We used the **Google Places API** to create a map displaying nearby locations of establishments carrying ICEE's.

### Challenges We Ran Into

Beginning our app development, using the limited resources of the Google Places interface was the least of our problems. Integrating both Google Places API and Google Maps API to work simultaneously proved to be almost impossible after about 8 hours of coding. Attempting to obtain the current location of said user using the Google Maps API on Xcode outputted a return of 'nil' at every test run. Our second challenge was obtaining a post request using the software Postman from the ICEE Locator on the ICEE website, which output a 500 Internal Service Error unfixable on our part.

### Accomplishments That We're Proud Of 

**As our first time using Swift and creating an iOS App**, we are both happy and completely surprised at the outcome of our app. While sharing our project with people at BrickHack, we were relieved to hear the **positive responses** and the numerous *"I love ICEE's!"*, *"I'd get it!"* and even *"I'd pay $5 dollars for that!"*.

### What We Learned

In the beginning, we thought Python could just as easily be linked into HTML as an external stylesheet just like CSS. We were very wrong. After talking to other students and mentors at HackAE, we learned more about how to actually incorporate Python into web development. We converted our Python survey into an HTML survey after realizing that we could not add Python directly into HTML. It was a great learning experience, and a gateway to learning more about how to incorporate Pythong into an HTML file in its endless ways.
